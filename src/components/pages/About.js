        Hey, I'm Markendrick but I go by "Mark" for short. I was born on 
        January 10, 1998 in th city of Newark, New Jersey to second generation 
        haitian immigrants. At the age of 8, my parents decided to move us from New Jersey 
        to the Atlanta metro area where also my grandparents were residing. There I began to attend 
        the local public schools for my primary education. At a very young age, I developed a high 
        interest for music. I started off playing the guitar until one day I clogged the sink and my 
        father founded out it me. Later he smashed my guitar to pieces as if he had finished singing
        "The Campfire Song" with Spongebob. Afterwards he felt a little pity and remorse for me that 
        he went and bought a piano for me. Years later, I develop into being a fulltime musician and
        producer. All I can do is be thankful for my misdeeds as a child and continue to smile and laugh 
        everytime I see my father. Currently I am attending a Coding Bootcamp at Georgia Tech University
        where I am learning multiple coding languages and I hope it goes well.
